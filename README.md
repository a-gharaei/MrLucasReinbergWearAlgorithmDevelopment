# MrLucasReinbergWearAlgorithmDevelopment

This project is about developing a macro fracture wear algorithm for a kinematics-geometric grinding simulation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository in your desired directory
2. In the terminal navigate to the project directory

'''bash
cd "C:\some_directory\fracture_wear"
'''
3. Make a new virtual environment using [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/)

```bash
pipenv shell
```

Then install the required packages

'''bash
pipenv install requirements.txt
'''

## Usage

Main.py contains a simple example. Just run Main.py and see the macro fracture of a grain!
If you want to include it in a simlation, invoke the function apply_macro_fracture_wear() from the wear_models.py file.
